   <p>It might be unreasonable to claim that every person who has used Visit Bath's website is bound<br> by the company's Terms and Condition, whether they had actually read the agreement or not.

   <p>A better way to obtain acceptance is by using a "clickwrap" prompt. <br> This requires a person to confirm that they accept your Terms and Conditions before they use your service.<br>  You've likely seen this before with "I Accept" checkboxes and similar methods.</p>

	<p>A Terms & Conditions document for a website is an agreement the website makes with its users about how to use the site properly,<br>  as well as the obligations and responsibilities of each. Most websites, especially commercial websites, have a portion of the site devoted to Terms & Conditions, <br> because it's the most important document for letting site users know what is expected of them.<br>  For owner/operators running any kind of business or personal website that allows user interaction,<br>  it's a good idea to have a clearly laid out document with all the Terms & Conditions required.
	</p>
	<p>One of the primary functions of a Terms & Conditions document is to outline what will happen in a variety of different possible situations, including if the user breaks the rules and must have his/her account terminated. If the user goes in knowing what to expect, it is less likely that there will be problems between the user and the website down the road.
	</p>
	<p>The Terms & Conditions document on any website creates a legally binding set of rules for the user, as well as, in most cases, the website owner. It's a place to set up expectations for each of the parties and ensure that the use of the website runs smoothly for both.</p>
